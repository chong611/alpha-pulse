## Using Your Website

Alpha Pulse aggregates market news from **six reliable sources**: Google News (multi-language), Reddit (with subreddit filtering), Yahoo Finance (ticker-based), MarketWatch (top financial stories), PR Newswire (press releases), and SEC EDGAR (recent filings).

**Getting Started:**

Click "Launch Alpha Pulse" on the homepage to open the full application. Enter your search terms in "Keywords" (like "AI" or "äººå·¥æ™ºèƒ½" for Chinese) and stock tickers in "Tickers" (like "AMD, NVDA"). For Reddit, add subreddits in "Subreddits" field (like "wallstreetbets, stocks"). Select your time window from the dropdown menu, then click "â–¶ Run" to fetch news from all enabled sources.

**Multi-Language Support:**

The application automatically detects Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in your keywords and fetches news in the appropriate language. For example, entering "äººå·¥æ™ºèƒ½" returns Chinese news articles from Chinese Google News sources. No configuration needed - just type in your preferred language.

**Custom Data Sources:**

Add your own RSS or JSON feeds in the "Custom URLs" textarea. Enter one URL per line and use `{query}` as a placeholder for keywords. Example for Reuters articles: `https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={query}+site:reuters.com&hl=en`. Example for Chinese news: `https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={query}&hl=zh-CN`.
